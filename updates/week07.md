## Biggest risks

* Due to the impact of lockdown 3, homeschooling and caring responsibilities will affect people's capacity to deliver and for people (Citizens and Internal Staff) to have input into the design and delivery of this service

Impact - the Options Appraisal and Alpha programme has been by 8 weeks to mitigate lost time in Q3 and expected lost time in Q4. The Alpha phase and Outline Business Case are likely to be finished towards the end of May 2021.
