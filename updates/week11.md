## Blockers, issues or questions

* Consideration and decision required around if we are providing landline calls and Interactive Voice Recognition at the existing volumes as this may require a "cloud contact centre type capability" and influence the design, architecture and development.

## Biggest risks

* Due to the impact of lockdown 3, homeschooling and caring responsibilities will affect people's capacity to deliver and for people (Citizens and Internal Staff) to have input into the design and delivery of this service
